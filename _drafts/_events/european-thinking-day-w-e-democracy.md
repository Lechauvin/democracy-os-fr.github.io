The 21st century democracy in Europe is in dire straits. Citizens feel disconnected with politics, and a growing distrust has in 2014 led to the lowest participation in European elections ever. According to the latest Eurobarometer, a staggering 54% of citizens thinks that their voice doesn’t count in the EU. Democracy seems overdue for a profound upgrade. How can we reverse the erosion?

Our digitizing society forms a fertile breeding ground for citizens to get organized in innovative ways, and gain more power to influence and even co-create policy decisions that affect their lives. Digital initiatives like online knowledge centres and participation platforms are popping up all over Europe. What is the potential of these technologies to transform and rethink democracy? What are the threats? And how can local governments anticipate to this growing tendency?

(W)E-Democracy takes a look from different angles at promising (citizen) initiatives who employ digital tools to strengthen democracy. We invite Léa Caillère to talk about young greens in action against mass surveillance. Lina Dencik from Cardiff University will present a study on citizen rights in a digitized society. We then discuss two successful online platforms: CitizenLab, introduced to us by founder Wietse Van Ransbeeck and DemocracyOS France, presented by its President Caroline Corbal. Next, Xabier E. Barandiaran and Arnau Monterde, driving forces behind Decidim Barcelona, will share their experiences with open democracy on city level. Last but not least, Imade Annouri, Green Member of Flemish Parliament, and Dóra Björt Guðjónsdóttir, Chair of the Young Pirates in Iceland, will reflect on the possibilities of e-democracy for political parties.

Free entrance. Registration needed.
